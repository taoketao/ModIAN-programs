# ModIAN-programs
Uploading the old code I wrote while implementing my ModIAN idea. 

April 2020
This is code I wrote back in 2016/2017 to test an idea for a novel 
tensor neural network. While I discontinued the project, I am happy with
how I conducted the experiments and want to show off the code I wrote 
while still an undergraduate.

The main program is ./implementations/ModIAN.py. 
I found it helpful to look at the plots to get a glimpse of the work.
See also in /documents/ :  info.txt, info-3-14.txt, info2.txt.

Work uses Tensorflow and was performed on a small remote lab cluster.
I give zero guarantees that the code works.
